The columns are separated by the tab key, i.e., "\t", so that you can easily import the data into MySQL database with command like this:

The columns are (from left to right):
01	PDB ID
02	Chain
03	Resolution. "-1.00" stands for lack of resolution information, e.g. for NMR
04	Catalytic site residues (different sites are separated by ';') (with PDB residue numbering)
05      Catalytic site residues (different sites are separated by ';') (with residue re-numbered starting from 1)
06	EC number
07	GO terms
08	UniProt ID
09	PubMed ID
